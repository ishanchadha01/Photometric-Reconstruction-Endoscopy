## Setup

Make sure Eigen, OpenCV, and Ceres are installed. Add Ceres installation location to environment variable called `CERES_PATH`.

After cloning the repo, run the following:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../photometric_reconstruction
make
```
Edit the `get_camera_params()` function with your camera's parameters based on the paper.

## Calibration
